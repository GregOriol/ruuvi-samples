# ruuvi-samples
Node script to retrieve data samples (temperature, humidity, pressure, ...) from Ruuvi BLE tags.

The scripts listens for n samples from a list of devices (defined by mac address) and stores them in a json file for further processing.

Inspired by Ruuvi's scanner code (https://github.com/ruuvi/ruuvi.scanner.js), some code and license is inherited from it.
